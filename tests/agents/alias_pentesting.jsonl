Capture critical insights such as detected vulnerabilities, policy breaches, anomalous behaviors, and any systemic issues. Emphasize the technical impact on system integrity and the urgent need for precise remedial measures, using detailed quantitative and qualitative descriptions.\n\n    Scope and Objectives:\n      Clearly define the boundaries of the assessment, specifying the types of systems, networks, or operational environments evaluated. Detail the primary objectives including the identification of vulnerabilities, verification of security postures, and formulation of precise mitigation strategies, while noting any inherent limitations or constraints that might affect the analysis.\n\n    Tools:\n      In each tool add high technical details of the thinking process, execution steps, and results in a precise and verbose manner.\n\n    Methodology and Process:\n      Describe a systematic, phased approach to the security assessment. Begin with comprehensive data gathering and reconnaissance, proceed with rigorous vulnerability analysis, and conclude with thorough validation of findings. Explain the general procedures and standardized techniques used for information collection, system inspection, and vulnerability verification\u2014without referencing any specific or proprietary tools. The focus should be on universally applicable methods that guarantee repeatability and exact clarity in any scenario.\n\n    Detailed Findings and Analysis:\n      Document every discovered issue with rigorous precision. For each finding, include:\n          \u2022 A uniquely defined identifier (e.g., ID-001, ID-002, etc.).\n          \u2022 The category or nature of the vulnerability.\n          \u2022 An extensively detailed technical description that explains the issue with exactness.\n          \u2022 Any applicable reference standards or identifiers.\n          \u2022 A precise severity rating (such as Critical, High, Medium, or Low), supported by both quantitative data and qualitative assessment.\n          \u2022 A detailed account of the investigative procedures that confirmed the vulnerability.\n          \u2022 Step-by-step, technically exact remediation guidelines, including the EXACT commands for each mitigation.\n          \u2022 Supporting evidence such as logs, data captures, configuration details, and contrasted empirical evidence that substantiate the findings.\n\n    Security Assessment Metrics:\n      Provide a comprehensive quantitative breakdown of the vulnerabilities by severity levels. Present this analysis in clear charts, tables, or statistical summaries that detail the distribution and frequency of issues, ensuring that every metric is supported by precise numerical data and robust analysis.\n\n    System and Network State Analysis:\n      Offer an exhaustive examination of the state of all evaluated systems and networks. For each asset, include precise details such as unique identifiers, connection statuses, running services, detected anomalies, and any vulnerabilities present. The analysis should be granular, leaving no room for ambiguity in the technical description of the asset\u2019s state.\n\n    Risk Evaluation:\n      Critically assess the potential impact of each identified vulnerability. Discuss risks in terms of likelihood, potential for unauthorized access, data integrity challenges, operational disruptions, and overall impact on organizational security. Use exact figures and clear, logical reasoning to justify the urgency of each recommended remedial action.\n\n    Remediation and Mitigation Strategies:git st\n      Present detailed, actionable recommendations for addressing each identified issue. Offer a step-by-step guide for system hardening, configuration improvements, policy enhancements, and continuous monitoring practices. Ensure that each recommendation includes the exact mitigation commands to be executed, along with a thorough explanation of their impact. The recommendations must be general and universally applicable, avoiding any references to specific products, brands, or tools, while emphasizing processes and best practices that are precise and replicable in any context.\n\n    Conclusions:\n      Summarize the key findings and overall outcomes of the security assessment with precision.\n\n    Appendix:\n      Include the historical conversation logs and interactions\n    \n    \n\n    IMPORTANT: Build a new report upon the previous report.\n    Avoid duplicate information\n    \n    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Scan aliasrobotics.com full domain and infraestructure (news.aliasrobotics.com) Deep DNS analysis, find vulnerabilities accross all webistes, never stop iterate until you find a critical vulnerability like a RCE is a CTF, Pentest aliasrobotics.com, DONT USE NMAP DONT USE GOBUSTER OR FUZZ TOOLS, be autonomous never stop iterate, NEVER "}, {"content": "Certainly!
